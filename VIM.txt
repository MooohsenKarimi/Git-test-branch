Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient.  
It is an improved version of the vi editor, distributed with most UNIX systems.  

Vim has multiple modes:  
- Normal mode is for navigation and editing commands.  
- Insert mode is for typing text.  
- Visual mode is for selecting text.  
- Command-line mode is for entering commands like saving or quitting.  

Because of its efficiency, Vim is often called a "programmer's editor."  
It is available on almost every operating system and is widely used by developers and system administrators.
